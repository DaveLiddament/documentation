Deploying API Tools
===================

You've developed an API using API Tools, you've finished testing and documenting, and now you are
ready to push to production. How do you deploy the API?

Since API Tools 1.1 we added in the Admin UI the "Package page" that can be used to create the
package file containing the APIs ready for deployment.

The package feature of API Tools is based on the usage of [zf-deploy](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy),
a command line tool to package [Laminas](https://docs.laminas.dev/) (and
Laminas MVC) applications in a single file ready to be deployed.

Preparing to deploy
-------------------

A couple items to consider when preparing to deploy are (a) production configuration, and (b) the
landing page of your application.

API Tools builds on the Laminas MVC skeleton. This skeleton includes configuration for where to
find configuration files, as well as version control rules for excluding what is dubbed "local"
configuration. Essentially, the MVC looks for application configuration files in the `config/autoload/`
tree, and has separate globs for those suffixed with `global.php` and those suffixed with
`local.php`; additionally, the latter, "local" files are omitted from version control by default.
_This makes them the recommended location for environment specific configuration, and particularly
any configuration involving credentials or specific servers._

We recommend keeping your production configuration separate from the application repository. This
can mean storing them in a separate, private repository -- for example, scripts that are uploaded
with tools such as [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/), [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/), or
[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/). Alternately, if you keep this information in another repository,
you can also use the zf-deploy tool, outlined below, to slurp in the production configuration when
creating a deployment package.

Regarding the landing page of your application, if you use the API Tools skeleton application, the
"home page" by default redirects to the API Tools welcome page -- which is disabled when in
production mode! As such, we recommend altering your
`Application\Controller\IndexController::indexAction()` method to do something other than redirect,
or to redirect to another page. This will mean removing the following line:

```php
// in module/Application/src/Application/Controller/IndexController.php:
return $this->redirect()->toRoute('api-tools/welcome');
```

and replacing it with something else; for example, to have it redirect to your end-user HTML API
documentation:

```php
return $this->redirect()->toRoute('api-tools/documentation');
```

> ### Update the home page!

> The landing page for your application will **not** work, _and will in fact raise an error_ if you do
> not make the changes to the landing page as recommended above!

Deploy using API Tools Admin UI
-------------------------------

If you are using the API Tools Admin UI you can deploy your APIs in one click! Just go to the "Package"
page, select the APIs to be included in the package, and click the "Generate package" button.

![API Package](/asset/api-tools-documentation/img/api-package-generate.png)

API Tools will generate a .ZIP file (default format) to be downloaded, that's it!
You can deploy this file in any PHP environments, including cloud infrastructures.

API Tools supports different file format for the package: ZIP, TAR, TGZ (TAR.GZ), and ZPK, the file
format used by [Zend Server](http://www.zend.com/en/products/server).  

You can check the "Execute composer" option to include the composer install in the package.
This option can be relevant if you want to create a package ready to be deployed as is. If you have
a deploy process that already includes the composer execution, you can omit it (default value).
Moreover, you can set off the execution of composer if you need to deploy an update package that does
not require a composer update.

Finally, in the "Package" page you can specify the path of the configuration file to be included
in the package. Usually, the configuration files of a production environment are different from a
testing one, so you can use this option to manage this difference.


Manual deployment using Composer
--------------------------------

One way to deploy an API Tools application is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to create a
production package. This method requires the following 3 steps:

### Composer: Step 1

Copy all the application files into a new directory, omitting the `vendor/` and `.git/` directories,
the `composer.lock` file, and all local configuration files:

```console
$ rsync -a --exclude-from=".gitignore" --exclude=".git" /source /destination
```

Note the usage of the `--exclude-from` option to exclude all the files reported in `.gitignore`.
The `.gitignore` file specifies omitting the `vendor/` directory, the `composer.lock` file, and all
the local configuration files such as `config/development.config.php` and
`config/autoload/*.local.php` that should not be included in a production environment.

### Composer: Step 2

Execute the Composer installer in the destination folder, indicating that development dependencies
should be omitted. (If `composer.phar` is not included in the destination folder, you can download
it [from the Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar).)

```console
$ php composer.phar install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
```

The above command also indicates that distribution packages should be used if available (which will
reduce the overall size of your installation package), and to generate the production-optimized
autoloader.

### Composer: Step 3

After installing dependencies, you can package the entire application and deploy it. For instance,
you can create a ZIP file by executing the following command inside the package folder:

```console
$ zip -r /path/to/package.zip *
```

(Where `/path/to` is the path for the `package.zip` output file.)

At this point, you have a package you can deploy to production using your preferred deployment
mechanism.

### Notes on deployment

One of the most important parts in the previous steps is the usage of the `.gitignore` file to omit
development configuration files. When you deploy an API Tools application in production you must be
sure that the files are aligned with the production environment.

Here are some specific API Tools files that you must omit in production:

- `config/development.config.php`: If this file is present, API Tools will be executed in
  "development mode," enabling the Admin UI publicly via the `/api-tools` URL.  You can switch off
  development mode in API Tools using the following command from the root of your project:
  `php public/index.php development disable`.

- `config/autoload/*.local.php` files are releated to your local environment.  Usually these files
  are not under version control and are specific to the environment; you will likely need different
  settings for your production environment. (**Note**: As part of Step 2 above, you may want to
  create appropriate local configuration files for your production environment to include in the
  package.)

- `.git/` directories usually are not required in a production environment; left in place, these
  directories can significantly increase the size of the package.


Deploy on Zend Server
---------------------

Once you have created your `package.zpk` file, you can deploy it using the *Deploy Application*
feature of Zend Server. Below is a video that introduce Zend Server features, including the
Deploy mechanism.

You can also deploy a ZPK from the commandline. To do this, download the [Zend Server Web API
SDK](https://github.com/zend-patterns/ZendServerSDK). Once you have it, you will
need to:

1. Create an API key in the Zend Server UI.
2. Create an SDK target.
3. Either deploy a new application, or update an existing one.

### Create an API key

To create an API key, first navigate to the "Administration" screen, and the "Web API" panel within
that screen:

![Zend Server Web API Screen](/asset/api-tools-documentation/img/deployment-intro-zfdeploy-create-api-key.png)

Click the "Add Key" button, and follow the instructions. You will likely need to assign the key
administrator permissions in order to allow deployment.

Make a note of the key name and hash, as you wll use them in the next step.

### Create an SDK target

Now use the key name and hash to create an SDK target, using the SDK's `addTarget` command:

```console
$ zs-client.phar addTarget --target=<target name> --zskey=<key name> --zssecret=<hash>
```

The `<target name>` is a unique name you will provide so that the SDK can later use the
configuration you provide when accessing the Zend Server API. You may also need to provide the
`--zsurl` option if you are deploying to a server other than `http://localhost:10081`, and the
`--http` option in order to disable peer verification if your Zend Server deployment is over SSL.

```console
$ zs-client.phar addTarget --target=api --zskey=api --zssecret=<hash> --zsurl="https://foobar.tld:100082" --http="sslverify=0&sslverifypeer=0"
```

For more information on the `addTarget` command, run `zsclient.phar addTarget --help`.

Make a note of the target name, as you will use it in the next step

### Deploy or update an application

If you are deploying an API for the first time, you will use the `applicationDeploy` method of the
SDK:

```console
$ zs-client.phar applicationDeploy --appPackage=<package filename> --baseUrl=<url application will run under> --target <target>
```

where `<package filename>` is the ZPK you created with `ZFDeploy`, `--baseUrl` is the URI you want
to run your application under, and `target` is the SDk target you created in the previous step.

You will also need to provide either the `--createVhost` or `defaultServer`, depending on whether
you want a new vhost created for the application, or if you want to use the default server. Finally,
we recommend passing the `--userAppName <name>` flag, in order to provide a human readable name for
the application.

For more information on the `applicationDeploy` command, run `zs-client.phar applicationDeploy --help`.

If you are updating an existing application that you have already deployed, first use the
`applicationGetStatus` command in order to find the application identifier:

```console
$ zs-client.phar applicationGetStatus --target <target>
```

Look through the results to find the application and its identifier.

Next, use the `applicationUpate` command:

```console
$ zs-client.phar applicationUpdate --appId <id> --appPackage <package filename> --target <target>
```

where `<id>` is the application identifier you discovered with `applicationGetStatus`,  `<package filename>` is the package you created with `ZFDeploy`, and `<target>` is the SDk target you created in the previous step.

For more information on the `applicationUpdate` command, run `zf-client.phar applicationUpdate --help`.
